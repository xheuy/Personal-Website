Thus, it is pretty impossible for owners to spare any time and energy for dog walking.In this way, owners choose to bring their pets out for strenuous exercise, like hiking, for the sake of compensating for the lack of exercise on weekdays. </p>

                <p>The retina is where scientists have found the key to the difference in color perception between dogs and people. The retina is composed of millions of light-sensing cells.<br> 
                It’s the composition of the cones that make the difference in color perception. Humans and a few other primate species are trichromatic, which means they have three kinds of cones. Dogs are dichromatic, having only two.<br>
                Each type of cone registers a different light wavelength. The one for red and green gives humans their appreciation for a red rose or a Granny Smith apple. Dogs, and some color-blind people, are missing red-green cones.<br>
                Dog Vision, a web site devoted to canine color perception, printed this side-by-side comparison of how the two species register the color spectrum.

        <h3>What Do Dogs See?</h3>
        <div class="T__wrap">
            <div class="layout-7">
                <p>Although we are unable to ask our pets to read an eye chart, through comparative studies, it is possible to make some educated assumptions about their vision.
                <br><br>
                The position of the eyes within the head determines the degree of peripheral vision as well as the amount of the visual field that is seen simultaneously with both eyes. 
                <br><br>
                This binocular vision is necessary for judgment of distances. Dogs have eyes which are placed on the sides of the head, resulting in a visual field of 240 degrees compared with the human field of 200 degrees. The central, binocular field of vision in dogs is approximately half that possessed by humans.</p>
