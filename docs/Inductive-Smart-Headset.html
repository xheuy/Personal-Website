        <h3>Perception of music</h3>
        <p>Music is a kind of organized sound composed of many elements. The brain processes music in almost all areas of the brain and the nervous system. The brain uses feature extraction and functional integration to process music: the brain restores a piece of music signal to its most basic element, and then presents these basic signals to different regions of the brain, processed in parallel by different nervous systems without interfering with each other. This is A bottom-up process.</p>

        <p>Researchers from Aalto University conducted a survey themed “Emotional Effects on Physiological Changes”. 700 volunteers from Finland, Sweden and Taiwan took part in the study. And the researchers examined temperatures in different parts of their bodies under different emotions and used the results to build this thermal imaging digram.</p>
        <h3>Mechanism of music</h3>
        <div class="layout-2">
            <p>Juslin (2013) summarizes some of the conjectures about how music affects emotions.<br>
            In the field of neuroscience, many studies have shown that listening to music can cause the activation of the limbic system. The main mechanism of neurogenesis induced by music emotion is the study of functional neuroimaging and lesion origin. Music can stimulate all the limbic and paralimbic brain structures, the amygdala in the center of the marginal and marginal brain structures, the hub of emotional arousal, maintenance, and termination; nucleus accumbens is the center of brain reward mechanisms Activating the nucleus accumbens releases dopamine, making people feel happy, forming a "reward circuit." </p>

        <h3>Literature Research</h3>

            <img src="images/work1/data3.jpg" alt="BG">
            <p>Bowling et al. (2010) have a very interesting study of the emotional aspects of music and speech, discovering both the content and the emotional atmosphere - the subdued state and the excited state, treating his study of memorization as melody and analyzing the relationship of intervals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="layout-4 T__wrap">
            <p>The study by Han et al. (2011) found that music generally has more significant pitch changes than tones of non-tonal languages, while tonal languages themselves have a greater magnitude than non-tonal languages Tone change. Non-tonal languages / tunes The language and culture of music is broadly in line with the above rules.</p>

            <p>Bowling's PhD dissertation (2012) contrasts the two mood-tuning languages with the pitch frequencies in syllabic music, and the two still show strong correlations. He also found that the color difference between major and minor music is due to the fact that the musical relationship of these music is quite similar to that of the excited / subdued feelings of human speech.</p>

                ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                In most aspects of music—e.g., intensity, tempo, and rhythm—the emotional quality of a melody is conveyed at least in part by physical imitation in music of the characteristics of the way a given emotion is expressed in human behavior.

                According to a large amount of research data in the above literature, it can be concluded that music is directly related to the mood of a person. For example, people may listen to some sad and sad music with smaller amplitude and frequency when they are sad, and may listen to relatively fast , The amplitude of the smaller music; emotionally excited to listen to the amplitude, the frequency is very large passionate music; happy mood to listen to some stable amplitude, frequency of music.
